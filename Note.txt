Day 3: 
npm install react-icons
	Under component create Modals.tsx
		crate actions and Button.tsx

Day 4: 
npm install zustand
npm install axios
npm install react-hook-form

		*ensure the network connection is not blocked such as public wifi
npm install next-auth @prisma/client @next-auth/prisma-adapter
npm install bcrypt
npm install -D @types/bcrypt
	under app/libs create prismadb.ts (to ensure hot reloading of next.js. allow one 			instances of prismaCLient created)

	under app/api/register create route.ts 
SUMMARY: 	***prismadb is create instance of db and prevent hotloading***

Day 6: Login functionality
	Duplicate RegisterModal and UseRegisterModal to LoginModal and UseLoginModal
		Edit submit function using signIn import from next-auth/react. Using Next13 authenticate with server componenet
	Create getCurrentUser.ts to confirm the authentication on server side
		pass it to layout.tsx(which is a server side, or it can directly call in layout without creating getCurrentUser.ts, but to make code nicer we separate)
		getCurrentUser instance is pass to Navbar then to UserMenu
			when getCurrentUser instance is true, the UserMenu will changed different view ["my trips", "my properties", "airbnb my home", "settings", "logout", etc...]
			set logout button using signOut from next.auth/react
			hydration occurs as dateTime object is not able pass to client component from server component, thus fix it by changing it to string via .toISOString and create app/types/index.ts

**next enables social logins**
